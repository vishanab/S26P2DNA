//former student, or any other unauthorized source, either
//modified or unmodified.
//
//- All source code and documentation used in my program is either
//my original work, or was derived by me from the source code
//published in the textbook for this course. I understand that
//I am permitted to use an LLM tool to assist me with writing
//project code, under the condition that I submit with the
//project a disclosure of LLM use as required for the project.
//I understand that I am responsible for being able to complete
//this work without the use of LLM assistance.
//
//- I have not discussed coding details about this project with
//anyone other than my partner (in the case of a joint
//submission), instructor, ACM/UPE tutors or the TAs assigned
//to this course. I understand that I may discuss the concepts
//of this program with other students, and that another student
//may help me debug my program so long as neither of us writes
//anything during the discussion or modifies any computer file
//during the discussion. I have violated neither the spirit nor
//letter of this restriction.
